# Propeller ORM

Propeller ORM is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for PHP7.

## A quick tour of the features ##

Propeller has some nice features you should know about:

 - It's a fast and easy way to manage your database;
 - It provides command line tools for generating code (well documented with an IDE-friendly syntax);
 - It's very flexible: you can simply extend any Propeller model;
 - It uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) so it allows you to use the RDBMS of your choice (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MSSQL are supported);
